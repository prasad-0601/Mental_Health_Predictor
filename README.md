# Mental_Health_Predictor
This project focuses on analyzing mental health data, specifically related to depression, using machine learning models. The goal is to explore and predict depression symptoms based on various features within the dataset using multiple machine learning algorithms.
Project Overview
The project consists of three key components, implemented through Jupyter notebooks:

f1.ipynb: This notebook provides an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the depression dataset. It includes data visualization, feature selection, and basic data preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for modeling.
f2lineal.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the implementation of linear models. It explores various linear algorithms such as logistic regression and evaluates their performance based on common metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
f3_rbf.ipynb: In this notebook, a non-linear approach is employed using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to capture more complex relationships in the data.
Additionally, the Python script h1.py contains utility functions that assist in running experiments and processing data.
